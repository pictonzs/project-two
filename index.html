        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a recent transfer into the Information Technology and Managment
          Program at Illionis Tech in Chicago, Illinois. I'm currently enrolled in
          several classes, the most interesting of which is my web design class.
          This is due to the fact that I'm hoping to major in Information Technology
          and Management with a specilization in front end design and web
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I compose and play music of several genres, reaching from
          solo piano jazz arrangements, to singer-songwriter songs on guitar, to
          full choral and orchestral works and everything in between. Additionally,
          I've recently started teaching myself how to paint and have found a lot of
          fufillment in working with a visual medium. This could be attributed to
          the fact I've recently discovered a lot for aesthetic design in general,
          ranging from room decoration to, as is obvious, web design
