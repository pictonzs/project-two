          Over quarantine, I found myself needing a large project to commit
          myself to help fill up the seemingly endless downtime. As a result, I
          took up the hobby of arranging various jazz standards for piano and
          then teaching myself  them. When I was arranging these pieces, I tried
          to capture the various  moods given by the pieces and stay faithful to
          creating the themes and atmospheres of these pieces. In the following
          list, I'm planning on detailing the research I did for these pieces.
          Hope you enjoy!

                Sunday at the Village Vanguard, which in my opinion showcases
                the pristine harmony from the songs very basic reliance on 2-5-1
                chord progresssions

                I personally arranged this piece keeping in mind that every
                voice being played, both the melody and harmony lines, should
                have a constant melodic movement as the song is centered
                around hearing music
